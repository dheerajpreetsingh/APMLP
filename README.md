# APMLP
APMLP (Attractiveness Predictor Machine Learning Project) is my first project of ML and under BYOP organised by DSG, IITR. This projects aim is to predict facial attractiveness of a face from a dataset using multiple variables which are to be extracted from face images. I aim to use different techniques and highlight important discoveries.
