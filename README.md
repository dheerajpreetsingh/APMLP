# APMLP
APMLP (Attractiveness Predictor Machine Learning Project) is my first project of ML and under BYOP organised by DSG(Data Science Group), IITR. This projects aim is to predict facial attractiveness of a face from a dataset using multiple variables which are to be extracted from face images. I aim to use different techniques and assess how it affects model's accuracy and highlight important discoveries from the data.
